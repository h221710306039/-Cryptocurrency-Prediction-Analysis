This project aims to predict the price changes of various digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, using cryptocurrency prediction models. These models use historical data of a certain cryptocurrency to forecast future prices using a variety of methodologies, including machine learning, deep learning, sentimental analysis, and statistical analysis.

### Methodology
We have used common methods to predict the market, including time-series analysis, machine learning, statistical analysis, and sentimental analysis. We obtained the dataset from Yahoo Finance and checked for anomalies, which were minimal compared to the data.

<i> To run the .ipynb notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your local machine. Once you have installed it, simply navigate to the directory where the .ipynb notebook is located, and run the command jupyter notebook or jupyter lab in the terminal. This should open a web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface, where you can open the .ipynb file and run the code cells. Alternatively, you can also use an online platform such as Google Colab to run the notebook without installing anything on your local machine.</i>
