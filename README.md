### <i> Authors: Atman Patel, Yeshwanth Myla </i>

This project aims to predict the price changes of various digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, using cryptocurrency prediction models. These models use historical data of a certain cryptocurrency to forecast future prices using a variety of methodologies, including machine learning, deep learning, sentimental analysis, and statistical analysis.

### Methodology
We have used common methods to predict the market, including time-series analysis, machine learning, statistical analysis, and sentimental analysis. We obtained the dataset from Yahoo Finance and checked for anomalies, which were minimal compared to the data.

So far, we have achieved forecasting future prices based on trends and patterns in the data using time series analysis. Additionally, we have used models such as Moving Average, ARIMA model, and Double Exponential Smoothing to train the model and forecast prices.

As of now, we have forecasted the prices for two stocks, and we plan to complete the coding process in the next class. We will then work on technical analysis and visualization.

### Disclaimer
Although cryptocurrency prediction models can be helpful resources for traders and investors, there is always a chance of mistakes and inaccuracy. When making investment decisions, it's critical to consider a variety of data sources and to be aware of the limitations of any prediction model.

We hope that our project provides insights into cryptocurrency price prediction models and helps to inform investment decisions.


<i> To run the .ipynb notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your local machine. Once you have installed it, simply navigate to the directory where the .ipynb notebook is located, and run the command jupyter notebook or jupyter lab in the terminal. This should open a web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface, where you can open the .ipynb file and run the code cells. Alternatively, you can also use an online platform such as Google Colab to run the notebook without installing anything on your local machine.</i>
